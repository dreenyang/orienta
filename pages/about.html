                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Orienta was born from a deep understanding of the challenges faced by Chinese students pursuing careers in the United States. Our founders experienced firsthand the cultural gaps, communication barriers, and unique pressures that international students navigate when transitioning from academic success to professional fulfillment.</p>
                <p>The name "Orienta" reflects our dual mission: honoring Eastern cultural roots while providing orientation and direction in Western professional environments. We believe that successful careers are built not just on skills and knowledge, but on authentic self-expression and cultural confidence.</p>
                <p>Our approach is summarized in the words of former U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke: <em>"One mile. Three generations. One hundred years."</em> We help our clients accelerate their journey by bridging cultural understanding and professional opportunity.</p>
